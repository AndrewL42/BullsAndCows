# BullsAndCows
A text game of "Bulls and Cows." Created for fun to practice my C# skills (so the code is likely quite poor looking for advanced programmers). Tried to implement some concepts I haven't worked much with, such as enums and breaking up projects into smaller classes, so it's likely not the best performing or most logical code.
